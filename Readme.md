Please install and configure the following software

- Node 22.10.0
- npm v10.9 and above
- Yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install
```bash
    corepack enable
    yarn init -2
```

Note: this is using experimental typescript native support for node (https://nodejs.org/en/learn/typescript/run-natively)

Then run

```

## Dependencies used

### Express

Web server

Unit testing

### TS-Node

run typescript code, since node does not have stable support for typescript natively yet. Node22 includes experimental native suppoort, but I am not using it at the moment.
